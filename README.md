# Deslopify

A Chrome extension that automatically hides LinkedIn posts containing emojis or em dashes.

## Why?

It's all so tiresome.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `deslopify` folder

## Usage

Once installed, the extension runs automatically on LinkedIn. Click the extension icon to:

- Toggle filtering on/off
- See how many posts have been hidden this session

## What gets filtered

Posts containing:
- **Emojis** — 😀 🚀 💡 ✨ etc.
- **Em dashes** — the long dash (—) commonly used in "thought leader" style posts

## Vibe code disclosure

Most of this was vibe-coded. Use at your own risk. The rate limits are set fairly aggressively and may end up nuking your entire LinkedIn feed (if it is sloppy enough).
